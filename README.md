# PageDownloader
Downloads all available files on web page

Sorry for all the chaos in project folder but I'm too lazy, by the way if someone will join the project I ensure you I will organize it better :)

Requirements:
- Recent version of Python3 installed (I used 3.10.0rc2 but it's optional)

Additional step for Linux users ->
MacOS and Windows python versions have Tkinter embedded, you probably not so :
- sudo apt-get install python3-tk (since u're using linux you already know )

Only MacOS users :
- pip3 install tkmacosx (Dark mode can break Tkinter library, this extension will fix)

This program will download all avaible files on a web page inside your desired folder.

Usage:
- Pick-A-Folder on your desktop (for example : Exams -> A )
- Copy-paste the URL of the desired web page ("A" course web page with all pdf files)
- Username and password optionals (sometimes are needed)
- Pick "single page" or "All pages" on your needs (sometimes "single page" can be lazy so
  if you don't find what you're looking for in your folder try with "All pages"
 
 That's it, have fun!
