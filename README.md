# PageDownloader
Downloads all available files on web page

REQUIREMENTS:
- Recent python3 version installed, this program uses 3.9.7
- Tkinter library installed (usually embedded, skip this step).

Specific installations :
- MacOS :
- - Download tcl-tk from homebrew -> brew install tcl-tk
- - Extension to fix some UI components : pip3 install tkmacosx

- Linux :
- - Probably you're missing some tk libraries so -> sudo apt-get install python3-tk python-tk

- Windows: ( Could not work at all so just come back later )
- - If you run into an issue while launching the app you need to reinstall python and be sure that you're installing tcl-tk libraries. -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20044559/how-to-pip-or-easy-install-tkinter-on-windows



Usage :
- Just run "PageDownloader.py" using the interpreter. (For example on MacOS : python3 PageDownloader.py )
- UI is very simple. Choose a destination folder, insert URL desired, download and wait for result!
- If username and password are required you can add them, but default is "No"
- I suggest you to check "All pages" because sometimes Web sites can be tricky.
